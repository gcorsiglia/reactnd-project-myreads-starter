# MyReads App

For this project I created a book tracking app using React. I was provided with a static example of the CSS and HTML markup that may be used for the app, and it was my job to add interactivity to the app by refactoring the static code. This is the sixth project in the [Udacity Front-end Development Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001).

## How to View the App

To view the website:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Acknowledgments

The starter code for this project was provided by Udacity, including HTML, CSS, and backend server.
